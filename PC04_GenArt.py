The first turtle creates a warm color spiral that overlaps itself and fills up 
the screen. Then the second turtle creates a cool color archamedian spiral that 
is on top of the warm spiral to emphasize the contrast in colors. The art piece 
can be a symbol of the varying emotions we have as humans that range from hapiness 
(warm colors) to sadness (cool colors) and how often in life we have to find a way 
to balance these emotions.
